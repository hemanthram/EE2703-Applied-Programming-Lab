    "We know that the resonant frequency is given by $2\\pi f = 1/{\\sqrt{LC}}$. Also for the given setup, the capcaitance $C$ can be calculated as the series combination of $C_1 = \\frac{A\\epsilon_o}{d}\\; and\\; C_2 = \\frac{A\\epsilon_o\\epsilon_r}{d}\\; $which gives us :\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{C} = \\frac{1}{A\\epsilon_o}({L_y-h + \\frac{\\epsilon_r}{h}})$$ where,   \n",

    "### (c) Parallelizing the computation\n",
    "The central part of the computaitons done involve updating very huge matrices using their old values. Using for-loops for doing this would lead python to a crawl and thus would slow down the process. To parallelize these operations, we use **vectorization**. We splice different parts of the matrices required for updation and perform the update with these, in a single line. \n"
